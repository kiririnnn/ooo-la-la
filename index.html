        <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
        <br>
        I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were alble to see many things while we were there!
        <div day1 <h4> Day 1</h4>
          <br>

          On our first day, we started by visiting <em> Montmatre </em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (Check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em> la Seine </em>.

        <div day2 <h4> Day 2</h4>
          <br>

          On our second day, we went shopping on <em> Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.
          <br>
          <br> After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.

        <div day3  <h4> Day 3</h4>
      <br>  The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Pauk Gauguin and Alfred Barye.
